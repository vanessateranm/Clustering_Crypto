## The Power of Cloud and Unsupervised Learning

# Clustering Crypto

Background For this activity, one of our most important clients, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers, however, they are lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies. They asked me to help them make sense of it all by generating a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification. I will put unsupervivsed learning and Amazon SageMaker skills into action by clustering cryptocurrencies and creating plots to present my results.

We will perform the following main tasks:

Data Preprocessing: Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: Reduce data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.

Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.

Visualizing Results: Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

Deploy our notebook to Amazon SageMaker.
